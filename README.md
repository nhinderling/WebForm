# Laser Tag WebForm

This Webform was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Functionality wise it works the following way: 
- on Sundays the company is closed
- same day bookings are not possible
- there is a simple backend implemented that only allows for times to be booked that haven't been booked already in that session. A session starts when flask is running, and ends with shutting down flask.  

Repo build up: 
- storage.py : backend
- WebForm.js : almost all functionality
- BaseLayout.css : Styling for shared item accross the two "pages"
- WebForm.css : Styling for the WebForm page
- Confirmation.css : Styling for the Confirmation page

Needed to run: 
- working pyhton version (I use Python 9.6)
- npm for React (Node Package Manager)
- react (package should be included in repo from bootstrapping)
- Flask to run backend
- CORS for Flask 

Running it: 
- terminal 1: cd yourstorage/my-app/src , export FLASK_APP="storage.py", flask run
- terminal 2: cd yourstorage/my-app npm start

IMPORTANT: start backend before frontend, otherwise time data won't be loaded


# Getting Started with Create React App [React]

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
